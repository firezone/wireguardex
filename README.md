Elixir library for configuring [WireGuardÂ®](https://www.wireguard.com/) interfaces exposing a native library via NIFs implemented in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

This is done by wrapping innernet's [wireguard-control](https://github.com/tonarino/innernet/tree/main/wireguard-control) with [rustler](https://crates.io/crates/rustler).

## Getting started

Add `wireguardex` to your dependencies:
```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:wireguardex, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then you can just use wireguardex to manage your wireguard interfaces:

```elixir
# Imports for cleanliness
import Wireguardex.DeviceConfigBuilder
import Wireguardex.PeerConfigBuilder
import Wireguardex, only: [set_device: 2]

interface_name = "wg0"
private_key = Wireguardex.generate_private_key()
{:ok, public_key} = Wireguardex.get_public_key(private_key)
listen_port = 58210
fwmark = 1234

:ok =
  device_config() # <-- Start configuring the devices
  # Here we set configuration for the device
  |> private_key(private_key)
  |> Wireguardex.PeerConfigBuilder.public_key(public_key)
  |> listen_port(listen_port)
  |> fwmark(fwmark)
  |> set_device(interface_name) # <-- This actually creates the interface
```

After creation you could also add peers:

```elixir
  # Create a peer
  peer = peer_config()
  |> Wireguardex.PeerConfigBuilder.public_key(public_key)
  |> preshared_key(Wireguardex.generate_preshared_key())
  |> endpoint("127.0.0.1:1234")
  |> persistent_keepalive_interval(30)
  |> allowed_ips(["255.0.0.0/24", "127.0.0.0/16"])

  # Add peer to existing device
  :ok = Wireguardex.add_peer(interface_name, peer)
```

And easily delete it afterwards using its public key:

```elixir
  :ok = Wireguardex.delete_peer(interface_name, public_key)
```

To get information on an existing device:

```elixir
  {:ok, device} = Wireguardex.get_device(interface_name)
```

Finally to delete a device:

```elixir
  :ok = Wireguardex.delete_device(interface_name)
```

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `wireguardex` to your list of dependencies
in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:wireguardex, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

Wireguardex will try to download a precompiled NIF library. If you want to compile
your own NIF, you'll need to have Rust installed. The common option is to use
[Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

To force compiliation you can set the environment variable `WIREGUARDNIF_BUILD`
to `true` or `1`. Or you can set the application env to force the NIF to compile:

```elixir
config :ruslter_precompiled, :force_build, wireguardex: true
```

### Note about privileges

This library creates and modifies network interfaces. If you'd like to run this library as a non-root user, we recommend adding the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` Linux capability to the Erlang VM executable:

```sh
sudo setcap 'cap_net_admin+eip' <erlang_installation_path>/bin/beam.smp
```

If you're using [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage dependencies you can do:

```sh
sudo setcap 'cap_net_admin+eip' $(ls -1 `asdf where erlang 24.3.4`/erts-*/bin/beam.smp)
```

This can be handy for development and testing purposes.

**Note**: This will also give `CAP_NET_ADMIN` to any other Erlang programs using this `beam.smp` executable. If this is undesired, consider using a dedicated Erlang installation or `beam.smp` executable for this library.

## Features

* Manage wireguard interfaces
* Doesn't require a wireguard installation

## Tests

Running the tests in this library will also require a Rust installation, as the NIF is compiled
locally before running the tests.

Follow [these](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) instructions to install Rust.

Then you can run `mix test` as long as you have the [user privileges to create interfaces](#note-about-privileges).
